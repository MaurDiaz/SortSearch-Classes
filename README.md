Maintain a Sorted Dataset and Support Add and Find Operations

Create a simple set of classes representing a Sorted Dataset.

1. Create a base class representing a Sort class. The base class should contain methods for adding a new value, adding random values, sorting datasets, and display array elements.
2. Create a Search class that inherits the Sort class, and also contains a methods for Efficient Binary Search algorithm that utilizes the sorting method from the base class.
3. Complete all the incomplete methods from both of the class. And do not alter the Program class.
